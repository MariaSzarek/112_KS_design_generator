## General info
Program generates routes.csv with data
Sewage System Route Generator calculates the total length and depth 
of pipes for installation and generate pipeline routes with turtle. 
The generator is based on the A* algorithm.
Input data are kept in points.csv. Mandatory structure of the file:


>15, 10,  length and width of the building
>
>x, y
>
>8, 0, last point of sewage system, need to be (x, 0)
>
>10, 9, sample point
>
>1, 5, sample point
>
> ... , rest points


Program generates routes.csv with data:
* for each point connected to the sewage system routes (point by point)
* longest route
* length
* depth


## Technologies
* turtle
* csv

## Future developent
To return dimension of pipes depending on how many points are already 
connected to main pipe and change slope of pipes.

## Running
To run this project 
>python manage.py
